hello my name is david and this is my third project for the
ElysiumX Innovation Web Developer Internship

it includes features like
1. Search functionality for dog and cat keywords
2. Meet Them Button to move to pets section
3. pet cards
4. see on map Button
5. <iframe> tag that holds the map with different locations
and some other features

The UI design was just sketched on my notebook 
as an idea and simple wireframe.
